# 1.1 Assignment

## Setup

Open the CS3\_Student repository in Visual Studio Code that you cloned and downloaded in [Assignment 0.1](../../0.-getting-started/0.1-github/0.1-assignment.md)

Go to `Assignments\Unit01\01_exception_handling` folder.

Open the file `Assignment01.java` located in this folder and compile it.

You will get an **exception**. If you look closely at the `main` method you will see that there are 3 _questionable_ bits of code.

## Assignment

Use `try` and `catch` blocks in order to handle each of the exceptions.

Each exception should print a descriptive but user readable (and understandable) error message.

**Do not change any other code.**

## When you finish

Be sure to <mark style="color:red;">commit</mark> your changes and <mark style="color:red;">push</mark> them to Github using Github Desktop!&#x20;
