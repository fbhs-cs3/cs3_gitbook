# 1.2 Assignment

Write the indicated methods in the file `Assignments\Unit01\Assignment02.java`.

1. Open `data01.txt` and examine its contents. It consists of random values (both positive and negative) with a space or newline separating each. Write a method `findMinMax` that takes in the filename and finds the smallest and largest values in the data set and prints them out (clearly indicating what is being printed).
2. Open `data02.txt` and examine its contents. Each row in this data file consists of a student's first name and 9 grades (integers). Write a file called `summary.txt` which is each student's name followed by a space followed the average of that student's grades (as integers).
   * Each student should appear on a separate line and should be in the same order as in the dataset.
   * The average should be _rounded_ correctly.
3. Write the `main` method so that it runs each of your methods.

{% hint style="info" %}
Special note about `Scanner` when using `Scanner.next()`:&#x20;

If you are reading the last thing on the line, there is a newline character (`\n`) left behind. You either need to do an extra `.next()` call or a `.nextLine()` call at the end of the line to start reading the next line
