# 1.7 Regular Expressions

Many of the examples and explanations are from the [Java SE RegEx Tutorial](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/regex/)&#x20;

<mark style="color:red;">**Regular expressions**</mark> (regex) are a way to describe a set of strings based on common characteristics shared by each string in the set.

## RegexTestHarness.java&#x20;

We will use the RegexTestHarness class to explore regular expressions.  It is located in `Examples\Unit01\07_regular_expressions` folder.

For now, we won't worry about the code, just compile and run `RegexTestHarness`.

## String Literals

The most basic form of pattern matching supported by **regular expressions** is the match of a string literal. For example, if the regular expression is _foo_ and the input string is _foo_, the match will succeed because the strings are identical.

Try this out with the test harness:

```
Enter your regex: foo
Enter input string to search: foo
I found the text foo starting at index 0 and ending at index 3.
```

This match was a success.

{% hint style="info" %}
Note that while the input string is 3 characters long, the start index is 0 and the end index is 3.

By convention, ranges are inclusive of the beginning index and exclusive of the end index, as shown in the following figure:

<img src="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/figures/essential/cells.gif" alt="" data-size="original">

Each character in the string resides in its own _cell_, with the index positions pointing between each cell. The string "foo" starts at index 0 and ends at index 3, even though the characters themselves only occupy cells 0, 1, and 2.

With subsequent matches, you'll notice some overlap; the start index for the next match is the same as the end index of the previous match:

```
Enter your regex: foo
Enter input string to search: foofoofoo
I found the text foo starting at index 0 and ending at index 3.
I found the text foo starting at index 3 and ending at index 6.
I found the text foo starting at index 6 and ending at index 9.
```
{% endhint %}

## Metacharacters

Regex also supports a number of special characters that affect the way a pattern is matched.

Change the regular expression to `cat.` and the input to `cats`:

```
Enter your regex: cat.
Enter input string to search: cats
I found the text cats starting at index 0 and ending at index 4.
```

The match still succeeds, even though the dot "." is not present in the input string.

It succeeds because the dot is a <mark style="color:red;">**metacharacter**</mark> â€” a character with special meaning interpreted by the matcher.

The metacharacter `.` means "any character" which is why the match succeeds in this example.

The metacharacters supported: `<([{\^-=$!|]})?*+.>`

{% hint style="warning" %}
Note: There are two ways to force a metacharacter to be treated as an ordinary character:

* precede the metacharacter with a backslash, or
* enclose it within `\Q` (which starts the quote) and `\E` (which ends it).

When using this technique, the `\Q` and `\E` can be placed at any location within the expression, provided that the `\Q` comes first.
{% endhint %}

## Character Classes

The left-hand column specifies the regular expression constructs, while the right-hand column describes the conditions under which each construct will match.

| Construct            | Description                                    |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| \[abc]               | a, b, or c                                     |
| \[^abc]              | Any character except a, b, or c                |
| \[a-zA-z]            | a through z, or A through Z, inclusive (range) |
| \[a-d\[m-p]]         | a through d, or m through p: \[a-dm-p]         |
| \[a-z && \[def]]     | d, e, or f (intersection)                      |
| \[a-z && \[^bc]]     | a through z, except for b and c                |
| \[ \[a-z && \[^m-p]] | a through z, and not m through p               |

The most basic form of a character class is to simply place a set of characters side-by-side within square brackets.

For example, the regular expression `[bcr]at` will match the words "bat", "cat", or "rat" because it defines a character class (accepting either "b", "c", or "r") as its first character. &#x20;

Try these in the `RegexTestHarness`

### Negation

To match all characters except those listed, insert the `^` metacharacter at the beginning of the character class.

This technique is known as <mark style="color:red;">**negation**</mark>.

```
Enter your regex: [^bcr]at
Enter input string to search: bat
No match found.

Enter your regex: [^bcr]at
Enter input string to search: hat
I found the text "hat" starting at index 0 and ending at index 3.
```

The match is successful only if the first character of the input string does not contain any of the characters defined by the character class.

### Range

Sometimes you'll want to define a character class that includes a **range** of values, such as the letters "a through h" or the numbers "1 through 5".

To specify a range, simply insert the "-" metacharacter between the first and last character to be matched, such as `[1-5]` or `[a-h]`.

You can also place different ranges beside each other within the class to further expand the match possibilities. For example, `[a-zA-Z]` will match any letter of the alphabet: a to z (lowercase) or A to Z (uppercase).



Here are some examples of ranges and negation (test them yourself!):

```
Enter your regex: [a-c]
Enter input string to search: b
I found the text "b" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: foo[1-5]
Enter input string to search: foo1
I found the text "foo1" starting at index 0 and ending at index 4.

Enter your regex: foo[^1-5]
Enter input string to search: foo6
I found the text "foo6" starting at index 0 and ending at index 4.
```

### Union

You can also use <mark style="color:red;">**unions**</mark> to create a single character class comprised of two or more separate character classes.

To create a union, simply nest one class inside the other, such as `[0-4[6-8]]`.

This particular union creates a single character class that matches the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, and 8.

### Intersection

To create a single character class matching only the characters common to all of its nested classes, called an <mark style="color:red;">**intersection**</mark>, use `&&`, as in `[0-9&&[345]]`

This particular intersection creates a single character class matching only the numbers common to both character classes: 3, 4, and 5.

### Subtraction

You can use <mark style="color:red;">**subtraction**</mark> to negate one or more nested character classes, such as `[0-9&&[^345]]`

This example creates a single character class that matches everything from 0 to 9, except the numbers 3, 4, and 5.

Take a minute and revisit the [character classes table](1.8-regular-expressions.md#character-classes) above and make sure you understand what each one does.  Test them in the RegexTestHarness!
{% endhint %}

## Predefined Character Classes

The regex API in Java contains a few useful _predefined character classes_ which offer convenient shorthands for commonly used regular expressions.

| Construct | Description                               |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| .         | Any character                             |
| \d        | A digit: `[0-9]`                          |
| \D        | A non-digit: `[^0-9]`                     |
| \s        | A whitespace character: `[ \t\n\x0B\f\r]` |
| \S        | A non-whitespace character: `[^\s]`       |
| \w        | A word character: `[a-zA-z_0-9]`          |
| \W        | A non-word character: `[^\w]`             |

Constructs beginning with a backslash are called **escaped constructs**.

If you are using an escaped construct within a string literal, you must precede the backslash with another backslash for the string to compile.

```java
private final String REGEX = "\\d"; // a single digit
```

In this example `\d` is the regular expression; the extra backslash is required for the code to compile.

The test harness reads the expressions directly from the Console, however, so the extra backslash is unnecessary.

### Examples

```
Enter your regex: .
Enter input string to search: @
I found the text "@" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: . 
Enter input string to search: 1
I found the text "1" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: .
Enter input string to search: a
I found the text "a" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.
```

```
Enter your regex: \d
Enter input string to search: 1
I found the text "1" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: \d
Enter input string to search: a
No match found.

Enter your regex: \D
Enter input string to search: 1
No match found.

Enter your regex: \D
Enter input string to search: a
I found the text "a" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.
```

```
Enter your regex: \s
Enter input string to search:  
I found the text " " starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: \s
Enter input string to search: a
No match found.

Enter your regex: \S
Enter input string to search:  
No match found.

Enter your regex: \S
Enter input string to search: a
I found the text "a" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.
```

```
Enter your regex: \w
Enter input string to search: a
I found the text "a" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.

Enter your regex: \w
Enter input string to search: !
No match found.

Enter your regex: \W
Enter input string to search: a
No match found.

Enter your regex: \W
Enter input string to search: !
I found the text "!" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.
```

## Quantifiers

<mark style="color:red;">**Quantifiers**</mark> <mark style="color:red;"></mark><mark style="color:red;"></mark> allow you to specify the number of occurrences to match against.

| Greedy | Reluctant | Possessive | Meaning                                 |
| ------ | --------- | ---------- | --------------------------------------- |
| X?     | X??       | X?+        | X, once or not at all                   |
| X\*    | X\*?      | X\*+       | X, zero or more times                   |
| X+     | X+?       | X++        | X, one or more times                    |
| X{n}   | X{n}?     | X{n}+      | X, exactly n times                      |
| X{n, } | X{n, }?   | X{n, }+    | X, at least n times                     |
| X{n,m} | X{n,m}?   | X{n,m}+    | X, at least n but not more than m times |

Let's start our look at quantifiers by creating three different regular expressions: the letter "a" followed by either ?, \*, or +. Let's see what happens when these expressions are tested against an empty input string "":

```
Enter your regex: a?
Enter input string to search: 
I found the text "" starting at index 0 and ending at index 0.

Enter your regex: a*
Enter input string to search: 
I found the text "" starting at index 0 and ending at index 0.

Enter your regex: a+
Enter input string to search: 
No match found.
```

In the above example, the match is successful in the first two cases because the expressions a? and a\* both allow for zero occurrences of the letter a.

Notice that the start and end indices are both zero, which is unlike any of the examples we've seen so far.

The empty input string `""` has no length, so the test simply matches nothing at index 0. Matches of this sort are known as a <mark style="color:red;">zero-length matches</mark>. A zero-length match can occur in several cases:

* in an empty input string
* at the beginning of an input string
* after the last character of an input string
* in between any two characters of an input string

Zero-length matches are easily identifiable because they always start and end at the same index position.

#### Now change the input string to the letter "a" five times in a row:

```
Enter your regex: a?
Enter input string to search: aaaaa
I found the text "a" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.
I found the text "a" starting at index 1 and ending at index 2.
I found the text "a" starting at index 2 and ending at index 3.
I found the text "a" starting at index 3 and ending at index 4.
I found the text "a" starting at index 4 and ending at index 5.
I found the text "" starting at index 5 and ending at index 5.

Enter your regex: a*
Enter input string to search: aaaaa
I found the text "aaaaa" starting at index 0 and ending at index 5.
I found the text "" starting at index 5 and ending at index 5.

Enter your regex: a+
Enter input string to search: aaaaa
I found the text "aaaaa" starting at index 0 and ending at index 5.
```

The expression `a?` finds an individual match for each character, since it matches when "a" appears zero or one times. The expression `a*` finds two separate matches: all of the letter "a"'s in the first match, then the zero-length match after the last character at index 5. And finally, `a+` matches all occurrences of the letter "a", ignoring the presence of "nothing" at the last index.

#### What is the results if the first two quantifiers encounter a letter other than "a".

For example, what happens if it encounters the letter "b", as in "ababaaaab"?

```
Enter your regex: a?
Enter input string to search: ababaaaab
I found the text "a" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.
I found the text "" starting at index 1 and ending at index 1.
I found the text "a" starting at index 2 and ending at index 3.
I found the text "" starting at index 3 and ending at index 3.
I found the text "a" starting at index 4 and ending at index 5.
I found the text "a" starting at index 5 and ending at index 6.
I found the text "a" starting at index 6 and ending at index 7.
I found the text "a" starting at index 7 and ending at index 8.
I found the text "" starting at index 8 and ending at index 8.
I found the text "" starting at index 9 and ending at index 9.

Enter your regex: a*
Enter input string to search: ababaaaab
I found the text "a" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.
I found the text "" starting at index 1 and ending at index 1.
I found the text "a" starting at index 2 and ending at index 3.
I found the text "" starting at index 3 and ending at index 3.
I found the text "aaaa" starting at index 4 and ending at index 8.
I found the text "" starting at index 8 and ending at index 8.
I found the text "" starting at index 9 and ending at index 9.

Enter your regex: a+
Enter input string to search: ababaaaab
I found the text "a" starting at index 0 and ending at index 1.
I found the text "a" starting at index 2 and ending at index 3.
I found the text "aaaa" starting at index 4 and ending at index 8.
```

Even though the letter "b" appears in cells 1, 3, and 8, the output reports a zero-length match at those locations. The regular expression `a?` is not specifically looking for the letter "b"; it's merely looking for the presence (or lack thereof) of the letter "a". If the quantifier allows for a match of "a" zero times, anything in the input string that's not an "a" **will show up as a zero-length match**.

### Exactly n

To match a pattern exactly n number of times, simply specify the number inside a set of braces:

```
Enter your regex: a{3}
Enter input string to search: aa
No match found.

Enter your regex: a{3}
Enter input string to search: aaa
I found the text "aaa" starting at index 0 and ending at index 3.

Enter your regex: a{3}
Enter input string to search: aaaa
I found the text "aaa" starting at index 0 and ending at index 3.
```

If the pattern should appear again after that point, it would trigger subsequent matches:

```
Enter your regex: a{3}
Enter input string to search: aaaaaaaaa
I found the text "aaa" starting at index 0 and ending at index 3.
I found the text "aaa" starting at index 3 and ending at index 6.
I found the text "aaa" starting at index 6 and ending at index 9.
```

### At least n

To require a pattern to appear at least n times, add a comma after the number:

```
Enter your regex: a{3,}
Enter input string to search: aaaaaaaaa
I found the text "aaaaaaaaa" starting at index 0 and ending at index 9.
```

### At least m, at most n

To specify an upper limit on the number of occurrences, add a second number inside the braces:

```
Enter your regex: a{3,6} // find at least 3 (but no more than 6) a's in a row
Enter input string to search: aaaaaaaaa
I found the text "aaaaaa" starting at index 0 and ending at index 6.
I found the text "aaa" starting at index 6 and ending at index 9.
```

## Capturing Groups and Character Classes with Quantifiers

Until now, we've only tested quantifiers on input strings containing one character.

<details>

<summary>What should <code>abc+</code> be looking for? (Check your thinking in the RegexTestHarness)</summary>

* `a` followed by `b`, followed by `c` one or more times.
* **not** `abc` one or more times!

</details>

<details>

<summary>What should <code>[abc]+</code> be looking for? (Check your thinking in the RegexTestHarness))</summary>

* a or b or c, one or more times

</details>

<details>

<summary>What should <code>(abc)+</code> be looking for? (Check your thinking in the RegexTestHarness)</summary>

"abc" one or more times

</details>

#### Examples 1/2

```
Enter your regex: (dog){3}
Enter input string to search: dogdogdogdogdogdog
I found the text "dogdogdog" starting at index 0 and ending at index 9.
I found the text "dogdogdog" starting at index 9 and ending at index 18.

Enter your regex: dog{3}
Enter input string to search: dogdogdogdogdogdog
No match found.
```

Here the first example finds three matches, since the quantifier applies to the entire capturing group. Remove the parentheses, however, and the match fails because the quantifier {3} now applies only to the letter "g".

#### Examples 3/4

```
Enter your regex: [abc]{3}
Enter input string to search: abccabaaaccbbbc
I found the text "abc" starting at index 0 and ending at index 3.
I found the text "cab" starting at index 3 and ending at index 6.
I found the text "aaa" starting at index 6 and ending at index 9.
I found the text "ccb" starting at index 9 and ending at index 12.
I found the text "bbc" starting at index 12 and ending at index 15.

Enter your regex: abc{3}
Enter input string to search: abccabaaaccbbbc
No match found.
```

Here the quantifier {3} applies to the entire character class in the first example, but only to the letter "c" in the second.

## Differences Among Greedy/Reluctant/Possessive Quantifiers

### Greedy Quantifiers

"Greedy" because they force the matcher to read in (or eat) the entire input string prior to attempting the first match.

If the first match attempt (the entire input string) fails, the matcher backs off the input string by one character and tries again, repeating the process until a match is found or there are no more characters left to back off from.

Depending on the quantifier used in the expression, the last thing it will try matching against is 1 or 0 characters.

```
Enter your regex: .*foo  // greedy quantifier
Enter input string to search: xfooxxxxxxfoo
I found the text "xfooxxxxxxfoo" starting at index 0 and ending at index 13.
```

Uses the greedy quantifier .\* to find "anything", zero or more times, followed by the letters "f" "o" "o".

Because the quantifier is greedy, the .\* portion of the expression first eats the entire input string. At this point, the overall expression cannot succeed, because the last three letters ("f" "o" "o") have already been consumed.

So the matcher slowly backs off one letter at a time until the rightmost occurrence of "foo" has been regurgitated, at which point the match succeeds and the search ends.

### Reluctant Quantifiers

Take the opposite approach of greedy: They start at the beginning of the input string, then reluctantly eat one character at a time looking for a match.

The last thing they try is the entire input string.

```
Enter your regex: .*?foo  // reluctant quantifier
Enter input string to search: xfooxxxxxxfoo
I found the text "xfoo" starting at index 0 and ending at index 4.
I found the text "xxxxxxfoo" starting at index 4 and ending at index 13.
```

Starts by first consuming "nothing". Because "foo" doesn't appear at the beginning of the string, it's forced to swallow the first letter (an "x"), which triggers the first match at 0 and 4.

Continues the process until the input string is exhausted. It finds another match at 4 and 13.

### Possessive Quantifiers

Always eat the entire input string, trying once (and only once) for a match.

Unlike the greedy quantifiers, possessive quantifiers never back off, even if doing so would allow the overall match to succeed.

```
Enter your regex: .*+foo // possessive quantifier
Enter input string to search: xfooxxxxxxfoo
No match found.
```

Fails to find a match because the quantifier is possessive. In this case, the entire input string is consumed by .\*+, leaving nothing left over to satisfy the "foo" at the end of the expression.

Use a possessive quantifier for situations where you want to seize all of something without ever backing off; it will outperform the equivalent greedy quantifier in cases where the match is not immediately found.

## Boundary Matches

Until now, we've only been interested in whether or not a match is found at some location within a particular input string.  We didn't care about _where_ in the string the match was taking place.

You can make your pattern matches more precise by specifying _where_ in the string a match should take place. For example, let's say you're interested in finding a particular word, but only if it appears at the beginning or end of a line.

| Boundary Construct | Description                                       |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------- |
| ^                  | The beginning of a line                           |
| $                  | The end of a line                                 |
| \b                 | A word boundary                                   |
| \B                 | A non-word boundary                               |
| \A                 | The beginning of the input                        |
| \G                 | The end of the previous match                     |
| \Z                 | The end of the input (can be followed by newline) |
| \z                 | The end of the input (no newline after)           |

### Beginning/End of Line

```
Enter your regex: ^dog$
Enter input string to search: dog
I found the text "dog" starting at index 0 and ending at index 3.
```

Successful because the pattern occupies the entire input string.

```
Enter your regex: ^dog$
Enter input string to search:       dog
No match found.
```

Fails because the input string contains extra whitespace at the beginning.

```
Enter your regex: \s*dog$
Enter input string to search:             dog
I found the text "            dog" starting at index 0 and ending at index 15.
```

Specifies an expression that allows for unlimited white space, followed by "dog" on the end of the line.

```
Enter your regex: ^dog\w*
Enter input string to search: dogblahblah
I found the text "dogblahblah" starting at index 0 and ending at index 11.
```

Requires "dog" to be present at the beginning of a line followed by an unlimited number of word characters.

### Begins/Ends on word boundary

To check if a pattern begins and ends on a word boundary (as opposed to a substring within a longer string), just use \b on either side

```
Enter your regex: \bdog\b
Enter input string to search: The dog plays in the yard.
I found the text "dog" starting at index 4 and ending at index 7.

Enter your regex: \bdog\b
Enter input string to search: The doggie plays in the yard.
No match found.
```

### Begins/Ends on non-word boundary

To match the expression on a non-word boundary, use \B instead:

```
Enter your regex: \bdog\B
Enter input string to search: The dog plays in the yard.
No match found.

Enter your regex: \bdog\B
Enter input string to search: The doggie plays in the yard.
I found the text "dog" starting at index 4 and ending at index 7.
```

## Using Regular Expressions with Strings

In order to make the RegexTestHarness, `java.util.regex.Pattern` was used.

`RegexTestHarness.java` is a pretty short program. You should review the code and try to understand what it's doing. &#x20;

```java
import java.io.Console;
import java.util.regex.Pattern;
import java.util.regex.Matcher;

public class RegexTestHarness {

    public static void main(String[] args){
        Console console = System.console();  
        if (console == null) {
            System.err.println("No console.");
            System.exit(1);
        }
        while (true) {

            Pattern pattern = 
            Pattern.compile(console.readLine("%nEnter your regex: "));

            Matcher matcher = 
            pattern.matcher(console.readLine("Enter input string to search: "));

            boolean found = false;
            while (matcher.find()) {
                console.format("I found the text" +
                    " \"%s\" starting at " +
                    "index %d and ending at index %d.%n",
                    matcher.group(),
                    matcher.start(),
                    matcher.end());
                found = true;
            }
            if(!found){
                console.format("No match found.%n");
            }
        }
    }
}
```

We will be using some `String` methods that mimic the behavior of the `Pattern` class.

### String Regular Expression Methods (not exhaustive)

`public boolean matches(String regex)`&#x20;

> Tells whether or not this string matches the given regular expression.

`public String[] split(String regex)`

> Splits this string around matches of the given regular expression.

`public String replaceFirst(String regex, String replacement)`

> Replaces the first substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement.

`public String replaceAll(String regex, String replacement)`

> Replaces each substring of this string that matches the given regular expression with the given replacement.

### A Code Example

We want to check if someone has entered a name (first and last only) with correct capitalization. That is, first letter of each word is capitalized, separated by exactly 1 space.

<details>

<summary>Write down your name in an acceptable way and an unacceptable way, then click to check your understanding.</summary>

"Chad Purdy" would be acceptable.

"ChadPurdy" is unacceptable (no space)

"chad Purdy" unacceptable

"chad purdy" unacceptable

etc.

</details>

<details>

<summary>Write the Java code that would check whether the <code>String name</code> is in an acceptable format.</summary>

```java
 String name = "Test Name";
 String regex = "[A-Z][a-z]+ [A-Z][a-z]+";
 String result = name.matches(regex) ? "ACCEPTABLE" : "UNACCEPTABLE";
```

Look closely at the regex line. What is it looking for?
