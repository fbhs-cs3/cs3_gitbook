# 1.3 Assignment

Open the file `Assignments\Unit01\03_do_while\SimpleTaxCalc.java`

This program will be used to calculate the subtotal and total of an order.

This program should:

* Introduce the user, explaining its purpose and expected inputs.
* ask the user to enter prices of items until they enter 0.
* ask for the tax rate as a percentage (ie. 8.5 would be 8.5%)
* display the subtotal (price before tax)
* display the total (price including tax)

To print a number to two decimal places, use printf:

`System.out.printf("%.2f", value);`

You **must** use a **do-while** loop correctly in order to get full credit.

Your program should correctly use `try/catch` in order to ensure that if the user types in anything besides a number the program asks for a valid input (reminding them what that is).
