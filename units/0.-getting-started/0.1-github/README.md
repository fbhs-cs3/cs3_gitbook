## What is Github?

At a high level, GitHub is a website ~~a~~nd cloud-based service that helps developers store and manage their code, as well as **track** and **control** changes to their code.  GitHub is a part of Microsoft that offers a cloud-based Git repository hosting service.  Essentially, it makes it a lot easier for individuals and teams to use Git for version control and collaboration.  In class, we will be using **Github Desktop** and the [Github Web Interface](https://github.com).

To understand exactly what **GitHub** is, you need to know two connected principles:

* Version control
* Git

### **Version control**&#x20;

Helps developers track and manage changes to a software projectâ€™s code through **branching** and **merging**.

With **branching**, a developer duplicates part of the source code (called the _repository_). The developer can then safely make changes to that part of the code without affecting the rest of the project.

Then, once the developer gets his or her part of the code working properly, he or she can **merge** that code back into the main source code to make it official.

All of these changes are then tracked and can be _reverted_ (undone) if need be.

### **Git**&#x20;

is a **distributed version control system.**  This means that the entire codebase and history is available on _every_ developer's computer, allowing easy branching and merging.

Git was created by Linus Torvalds (the creator of Linux) in 2005.

## Github Flavored Markdown

HTML: Hyper Text MarkUP Language - Used for formatting text, but difficult to read and write.![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/HTML5\_logo\_and\_wordmark.svg/1200px-HTML5\_logo\_and\_wordmark.svg.png)

**Markdown** was created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz in 2004 on top of HTML as an easier to read/write way of writing formatted text (but more limited than HTML)

All of the content on this webpage is actually written in markdown!

#### We will use **Github** and **Github Flavored Markdown** in class for most assignments.

For syntax and examples, refer to the **Markdown Syntax** and **Github Flavored Markdown** pamphlet given out in class.
