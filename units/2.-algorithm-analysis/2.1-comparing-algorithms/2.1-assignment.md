# 2.1 Assignment

For each of the following functions, find the upper bound. State a value of $$c$$ and $$n_0$$. The first one is done for you (note: the symbol ∴ means "therefore").

1.  $$f(n) = 3n + 8$$****

    **Solution**:

    &#x20;$$3n+8 ≤ 4n$$ for all $$n ≥ 8$$

    ∴ $$3n+8 = O(n)$$ with $$c=4$$ and $$n_0=8$$
2. $$f(n) = n^2 + 1$$
3. $$f(n) = n^4 + 100n^2 + 50$$
4. $$f(n) = 2n^3 - 2n^2$$
5. $$f(n) = 4n$$
6. $$f(n) = 410$$
